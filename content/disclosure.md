## FTC Disclosure

In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials, PulseInsight makes the following disclosure:

**Some of the links on this website are affiliate links.** This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.

## What This Means for You

- You will **never pay more** by using our affiliate links
- We only recommend products and services we have **researched and believe provide genuine value**
- Affiliate relationships **do not influence** our editorial opinions, ratings, or analysis
- We clearly identify content that contains affiliate links

## Our Affiliate Partners

PulseInsight participates in affiliate programs with select technology and SaaS companies. These partnerships help support our operations and allow us to continue producing free, high-quality content.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to honest, transparent content. If a product has shortcomings, we'll tell you — regardless of whether we have an affiliate relationship with them. Our readers' trust is more valuable than any commission.
